  2D ColliderGen - ChangeLog
===========================================================
-----------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.4
-----------------------------------------------------------

Compatibility:
- Unity5 iOS Mono 2.x compatible again (as well as IL2CPP).

New Features:
- Added collider preference default values for
  alpha threshold, force convex and flip normals.
- Added 'Window' menu entries for Collider Preferences
  window and ColliderGen TK2D Window.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.3
-----------------------------------------------------------

Compatibility:
- Unity5 compatible.
- IL2CPP and iOS-64BIT compatible.

Bugfixes:
- Removed an error console output when changing collider
  type between MeshCollider and PolygonCollider2D.
- Removed Warnings.
  
-----------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.1 and 2.2
-----------------------------------------------------------

Changes:
- Moved all menu items from a top-level "2D ColliderGen"
  entry to "Component/2D ColliderGen". Motivation was to
  comply with the official asset store guidelines.

New Features:
- Multi-Island Editing
  Added support for enabling, disabling and changing the
  outline vertex count of multiple collider islands or
  holes at once.

Bugfixes:
- Custom pivot of Unity 4.3 Sprites is now supported in
  static sprites and animations.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.0
-----------------------------------------------------------

New Features:
- Collider Animation support for Unity 4.3 Sprites
  PolygonCollider2D or MeshColliders can now be
  generated for each animation frame. Automatically
  switches to the corresponding collider at runtime.

Bugfixes:
- Windows Phone compilation issues resolved.
- Several minor bugs removed.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.4
-----------------------------------------------------------

New Features:
- Added support for Unity 4.3 Sprites and PolygonCollider2D
  SpriteRenderer components are now automatically
  recognized by AlphaMeshCollider.
  PolygonCollider2D can now be generated instead of
  MeshColliders as well.

Compatibility:
- Fixed an error with Windows Phone 8 deployment.

Minor Changes:
- Removed warnings of obsolete method calls in Unity4.3.
  
-----------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.3
-----------------------------------------------------------

Compatibility:
- Windows Phone 8 deployment works now.

Minor Changes:
- Removed warnings of obsolete method calls in Unity4.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.2
-----------------------------------------------------------

New Features:
- Added support for unlimited collider-island and –hole
  regions within a single texture image. Islands and holes
  can be enabled and configured via a new
  'Holes and Islands' section.

- Added support for OTTilesSprite. Simply add an
  AlphaMeshCollider to a GameObject with an OTTilesSprite
  component to generate colliders for it.

- Added a "Custom Texture Region" section to the
  AlphaMeshCollider parameters where you can specify a
  custom region to be used for collider computations
  (e.g. to use a custom frame from a texture atlas or
   spritesheet).

Bugfixes:
- SmoothMoves related:
  Collider scale was wrong when setting a custom image at a
  generic object (e.g. a plain quad) which had no
  SmoothMoves or Orthello sprite attached.

  Colliders attached to SmoothMoves BoneAnimation
  sprites can now scale along with it. Added an
  AlphaMeshCollider toggle parameter
  "SmoothMoves Scale Anim" to enable this behaviour.

- 2D Toolkit related:
  Changed the location of the ColliderGenTK2DParameterStore
  code file from Editor to Scripts directory. This prevents
  a problem that occurred with later versions of the Mono
  Compiler. Unfortunately, all ColliderGenParameters.prefab
  files that stored parameters for convenience of each
  sprite in a collection are no longer compatible and will
  be treated as non-existent.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.1
-----------------------------------------------------------

Compatibility:
-  This version is compatible with SmoothMoves V2.2.0 again.
   (Fixed BoneAnimation problems introduced with this
    SmoothMoves version - member variables have changed.)

New Features:
-  Added support for OTTileMap. There is now a menu entry
   "2D ColliderGen/Orthello Specific/Add AlphaMesh Colliders To OTTileMap".

Bugfixes:
-  Previously the bottom-left pixel was not included in the
   outline of objects. This lead to an incorrectly bevelled
   bottom-left corner at a square box (and the outline had
   5 vertices instead of 4).
   
-  Fixed a bug with Alpha Opaque Threshold not being
   synchronized across all instances of a collider-group.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0
-----------------------------------------------------------
-  Initial Release on the Asset Store
